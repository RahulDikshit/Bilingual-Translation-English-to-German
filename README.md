# Bilingual-Translation-English-to-German

The project aimed to build a highly accurate bilingual translation system for English to German using a large-scale translation dataset. The system was fine-tuned to optimize translation performance based on various evaluation metrics.

**Project Workflow:**

The dataset, containing approximately 1.9 million rows, was used to train the T5 small model for English-to-German translation. The model was fine-tuned using 3 epochs to improve translation quality.

**Modeling & Evaluation:**

**Model Selection:** The T5 small model was fine-tuned for optimal translation performance.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
**BERT Score:** Achieved a BERT score of 0.98, indicating high semantic accuracy in translations.
**BLEU Score:** Obtained a BLEU score of 82.55, reflecting strong syntactic accuracy and fluency in the translated output.

**Impact:**
Delivered high-quality translations with superior semantic and syntactic accuracy.
The fine-tuned model significantly improved the translation performance, making it more suitable for real-world applications.
This project showcased my ability to leverage state-of-the-art models for natural language processing and achieve near-human level translation accuracy.
